# Defaulter-Prediction
Banks nowadays offer services to their customers. The services include managing of accounts, offering loans, etc. The banks want to improve their services by differentiating good and bad clients. The bank managers have only vague idea about who is good client (whom to offer some additional services) and who is bad client (whom to watch carefully to minimize the bank looses). Fortunately, the bank stores data about their clients, the accounts (transactions within several months), the loans already granted, the credit cards issued. So the bank managers hope to find some answers by analyzing this data. In this kernel, I am going to follow the basic process of loan default prediction with machine learning algorithms.
Binary logistic regression is used when the dependent variable is a categorical, nominal variable(Defaulter). The variable defaulter has two levels-yes/no, hence binary logistic regression is performed. The necessary variables (age, defaulter) are converted to factor format. Logistic model is built, keeping threshold as 0.5, confusion matrix is generated. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, prevalence are calculated. In method 2, instead of using threshold as 0.5, using ROC the optimum threshold is found and used. The new confusion matrix shows better accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values.
